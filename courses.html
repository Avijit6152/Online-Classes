      <div class="item-10">
      <h4 id="list-item-10">Class 10</h4>
      <p>A paragraph in class 10 English usually consists of 100-120 words, containing 4-5 sentences. The paragraph should be concise and to the point, and the entire paragraph should be written in the same tense. The language should be simple and accurate, and no personal observation or feedback should be added.
        A good paragraph should be characterized by unity, coherence, and adequate development. The main idea of the paragraph should be stated in a clearly constructed topic sentence. The ideas should be arranged in a clear and logical order, and the paragraph should be developed with specific details and examples.
        Here is an example of an analytical paragraph in class 10 English:
        The pie chart shows the proportion of people from different households living in poverty in the UK in 2002.
        The chart shows that the majority of people living in poverty in the UK in 2002 were from households with one or two adults (57%). The next largest group was households with three or more adults (28%). The smallest group was households with no adults (15%).
        There are a number of possible explanations for these findings. One possibility is that households with one or two adults are more likely to be single-parent households, which are more likely to be poor. Another possibility is that households with three or more adults are more likely to have more children, which can also lead to poverty.
        Whatever the reasons, it is clear that poverty is a significant problem in the UK. The government should take steps to address this issue, such as providing more support for single-parent households and families with children.
        This paragraph is an example of a data-based analytical paragraph. It clearly states the facts and figures provided in the pie chart, and it provides a possible explanation for the findings. The paragraph is also concise and to the point, and it is written in a simple and accurate language.</p>
